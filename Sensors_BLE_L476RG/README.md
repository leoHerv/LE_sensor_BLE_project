# Sensors_BLE_L476RG

The project need a STM32L476RG Nucleo with an X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3 and an X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1 to work.  

The STM32L476RG Nucleo is the main board were the code is send and executed.  
The X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3 is used by the main board to retrieve the temperature, the humidity and 
the pressure.  
And the X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1 is used to send this data's via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).
